# Hola!

I've got two small requests for you.

1. Please raise your hand with conviction, if you think the Carpentries is an
awesome project!

Cool! That's why we are all here!

2. Please stand if you speak Spanish

Thank you!

# Why?

Now I want to make a point, when you think something is awesome and worth it,
you want to share it.

Why Spanish? because is the second most spoken language in the world.
